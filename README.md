- Zooplankton data 
- Went through Dave's script, renamed it to Combine_Ecodaat_EMA_Zoop, there was some lines in the script that didn't work, I updated them so they merged, but I don't think it represents all the species I am interested in, ie there is no Pseudocalanus. 
- Will likely need to go back and revise this, add weights for calanus, etc, but it works for now.
